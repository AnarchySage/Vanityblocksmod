V:3.2.3: Added Furnace recipes to get iron/gold back from doors, armor etc(must not be damaged). Added magma cream to slime ball recipe. Added rarity config option for the underwater ruins(it works like a 1 in? chance, such as setting it to 100, its a 1 in 100 chance per chunk). Added the coal coke and peat blocks to Fuel handlers correctly. Updated to 1.5.2, also used srg_names, so it may work on new versions(not a garrentee). Fixed a structure generation problem with ruins that went 1 block down incorrectly. Changed the dungeon loot spawns to only spawn what is enabled(example, if enderpearl blocks are disabled, they wont spawn in dungeons, etc).
V:3.2.2: Added World Gen for Underwater Ruins, currently using dungeon loot. Added Apatite, honey, honeydew and peat blocks from forestry(should only show up when forestry is loaded(temp textures are temp)). Added a rubber block from ic2/universal electricity/mfr.

Added in past version(not sure which XD), ability to decraft down your quartz blocks to the nether quartz item. Also added the ability to make green dye from Lapis lazuli blue dye and dandelion yellow dye. And i think thats about it.

V:3.1: Added Blaze blocks(which act as a glowstone light level block as well as a storage(will make fuel in next update)and burn infinitely like netherrack does in the world, Leather blocks, which stores 9 leather, and Bone blocks, 9 bones. Atm you need to mine all these blocks with a pickaxe, no way for me to seperate them to use other tools without more block id's :/
V:3.0: Updated to 1.5.1, removed legacy support. Please deblock all your redstone blocks(from my mod) and craft into vannila ones, thanks(will remove them later)


1.4.7
V:2.1: Added legacy support, meaning, all old blocks are named Blockhere - Legacy. Put them in crafting table to get new ones.
V2.0: Basically updated to metadata, using 4 id's now, ^ PLEASE UNBLOCK ALL YOUR STORAGE BLOCKS. Unfortuneally youll need to nei spawn back in your melting cores and lavalamps, sorry. (atm you cant use coal blocks in coke oven, still trying to fix it)
Now: if you dont wish to unblock them(and store them), download the 1.3.5 version and the 2.0, (backup your world), and deblock all your blocks and reblock them(the 1.3.5 disables recipes for making the non metadata ones)
