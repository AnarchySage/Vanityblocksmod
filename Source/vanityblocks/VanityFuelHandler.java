You might have noticed items return nothing. This is pretty simple to fix, you just need to change the return statement of the body of the If Statements. Note that this is tick for which the fuel lasts. To obtain how much you need in here, multiply the seconds you want by 20. So if I want books to last for 15 seconds, I would change the return after the Item.book.shiftedIndex to be 300. If I want my fuel item to last for 10 minutes (seriously) I would put 12000. To help you, here's a chart containing the values of vanilla items:
Wooden Slabs - 150
Anything made out of wood - 300
Wooden Tools - 200
Sticks - 100
Coal - 1600
Lava Bucket - 20000
Sapling - 100
Blaze Rod - 2400
